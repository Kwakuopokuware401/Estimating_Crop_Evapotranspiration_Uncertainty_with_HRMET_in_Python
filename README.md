# Estimating_Crop_Evapotranspiration_Uncertainty_with_HRMET_in_Python
Translating the HRMET evapotranspiration model to Python and applying it over gridded crop fields to estimate spatial ET uncertainty resulting from weather input errors. Focuses on perturbing inputs like temperature and radiation based on sensor specs and propagating through the Penman-Monteith model via Monte Carlo simulation.
